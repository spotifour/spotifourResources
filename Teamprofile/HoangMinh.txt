Those three tests are useful tools for me in learning more about myself, my personality, the strengths that I should focus on, and the weaknesses that I need to improve: 
○	My personality type is ESFJ, which implies I am an outgoing, energetic person who prefers to work in groups rather than alone. In addition, I am realistic, focusing on events that occurred in the past or present, and highly organized, valuing clarity and planning. 
○	In terms of learning style, I am more of a visual learner who understands and remembers information through sight. When learning something difficult, I tend to close my eyes and picture its image in my head. Hearing noises and engaging with them will not help me recall and comprehend things as well as seeing visuals would. 
○	I am not very creative, and I need to loosen and stretch myself, discuss thoughts and perspectives with other people in order to gain fresh viewpoints, and try out new approaches rather than sticking to the traditional ones. 

=> I believe the test result will influence my behavior in a team to some extent. When working with others, I will volunteer to do the work that is appropriate for me to maximize productivity. For example, I am a well-organized person who values structure and planning over spontaneity. Therefore, as part of a team, I will undertake planning the assignment, distributing tasks equally to each person and keeping track of the working process.
